        "My design journey was started through sport. I was in university and not terribly inspired by what I was studying. However, I was very inspired by a new nerdy sport called Quadball (based on Harry Potter and a mix of rugby and dodgeball) and I spent most of my time playing and designing my team's jerseys and merchandise. Once I realized that was my real passion, I changed gears and pursued a career in design. The photo is me playing for the University of Ottawa's Quadball team and wearing the first jersey I ever designed.",

        "Sport is a big part of my life. Back in Canada I played ice hockey, football, badminton, pickleball, and cycled. Since arriving in New Zealand, I have used sport to find community and settle into life in New Zealand. I unfortunately promised my family back home I wouldn't play rugby because my already injured body wouldn't be able to handle it, but getting to experience the rugby culture in New Zealand has been a priority for me. I attended the Black Ferns/All Blacks double header in July, followed the Black Ferns World Cup run and hope to experience more rugby while in the country. The opportunity to work with New Zealand Rugby would be an incredible experience and would be an ideal way for me to experience New Zealand. Thank you for considering my application, I hope to hear from you soon!",
