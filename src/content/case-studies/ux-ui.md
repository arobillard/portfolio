During my career I have lead user experience research, interviews and surveys, competitor analysis, site map and content strategy, wireframing, and user interface design. In my most recent role with Spruce Creative, I was our team's UX and web strategy expert.

    content: I have over 5 years experience teaching in the Mobile Applications Design & Development course at Algonquin College. I taught web design and development fundamentals and facilitated student capstone projects in the Applied Industry Projects course. The capstone projects are semester long group projects where students are matched with a real-world client to plan and build a minimum viable product based on the client's web/mobile app idea. My role as their professor is to lead the students through the user experience research, strategy, and design phases. I review their work at each stage, providing feedback and guidance to ensure their project has thorough UX research, informed strategic planning, and UI design that meets the project goals and while implementing the best practices and principles of human-centred design and accessibility.
