**[adamrobillard.ca](https://adamrobillard.ca)**

I've been working as a web developer, designer, and educator for over 6 years. I have experience working in every step of the web process including project management, user research, content structure/planning, design, development, deployment, and maintenance. I am passionate about the entire web process and my broad background allows me to bring knowledge to every stage and to provide the perspective needed to ensure all areas of a project work seamlessly together.

When not working or teaching, I usually can be found developing web projects just for myself as I believe that the best way to learn and improve is to experiment with new ideas and technologies. The projects found in this portfolio contain both work projects and passion projects.

If you are interested in any of the work I have done and want to connect to work together, I would love to connect!
