    title: Bohnanza
    content: Bohnanza is a game all about trading, planting, and harvesting different types of beans. It required a complex chat and trading system to allow players to communicate, offer, accept, and decline trades while following the game's strict rules. The game also features a phase system, where certain actions can only be done by specific players during specific phases. The game utilizes this phasing system to teach the player how to play while ensuring the rules and order are followed.

    title: Sushi Go
    content: In Sushi Go, players are trying to build the best sushi platter by selecting one card from their hand before passing the hand along and select another card from the next hand. You score points by combining different groups of sushi. The complexity of this game is in the scoring. Different cards interact with each other, add multipliers, or cancel out cards for other players, so making sure each unique combination would score correctly was incredibly important.

Extra features like the chat and "simple cards" view were added to improve the overall usability of the game.

    title: Why did I make all of these?
    content: I built these over the first two years of COVID when Canada was at the height of its lock downs. My friends and family all connect through games, so building and playing these games was a way to stay connected. It also gave me an opportunity to learn new skills and push myself. I was relatively early in my career at that point and building these games taught me a lot and gave me confidence in my abilities.
